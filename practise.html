        <h1>Here is an some Details About Supra A Car</h1>

        <!-- Here is the article of supra -->

        The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by
        the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning
        "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".[3] -->

        The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been
        produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from
        the Toyota Celica, but it was longer.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the
        Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra.[6] Owing to the similarity
        and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and
        third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation
        was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the
        G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.

        The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations
        were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. Interior aspects were also similar,
        as was the chassis code "A". Along with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It was
        derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when
        the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but
        without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval
        company logo. The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. It appeared on the first two
        generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica
        line until it was also discontinued.[citation needed]

        In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth-generation Supra in the United States.[6] Production of the
        fourth-generation Supra for worldwide markets ended in 2002. In January 2019, the fifth-generation Supra, which
        was co-developed with the G29 BMW Z4, was introduced.[7
